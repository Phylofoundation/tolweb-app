    <p>	Use this search to find Tree of Life branch or leaf pages for a 
       	particular group of organisms.  Scientific names will work best (e.g., 
       	Basidiomycota, Polemoniaceae, <em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>), but 
       	you can try common names (e.g., songbirds, ferns, monarch butterfly).
		This search will also work for other names such as synonyms that are 
		stored in our names index.</p>

    <h3 id="media"><a name="media"></a>Media Search</h3>
    <p> Use this search to find  media (images, movies, sounds, etc.) in
        the Tree of Life collection. <span class="stickies">You can fill out
        one or several of the fields below. If your search does not find the
        media you are looking for, try using fewer search criteria. Some 
        materials that fit your criteria may not yet have been annotated 
        accordingly and may therefore not show up in your media search results. 
        We are continuously improving the annotation of media files, so the 
        quality of media search results will improve over time.</span></p>

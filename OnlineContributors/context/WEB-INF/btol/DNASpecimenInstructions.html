<H3>Number and type of specimens to collect</H3>

   <p>For all species, a series of specimens is ideal, as sometimes we don't get enough good DNA from a single specimen, or sometimes we need to confirm the results from another specimen.  For species marked as high-priority (Tier 1, especially), multiple specimens is even more important.  
    The smaller the specimens, the larger the series needed. Here's a rough guide:</p>

   <p>In general, more is better than less, but don't fill a vial so full that the quality of the DNA is compromised.  Of course, one specimen is much better than none!</p>
   <p><i>There is always a preference for the sex that is easiest to identify.</i>  In most groups, this would mean a preference for males.  It will be important to tie the correct name to the molecular sequence data, so please bias those you save for DNA to be relatively easily identifiable.</p>


<H3>Fixing and preserving specimens for DNA</H3>

   <p>To ensure optimal preservation of DNA, collections ideally should be preserved in ethanol or dried in silica gel.  
   They should ideally be less than 5 years old, and preferably less than 2 years old.  We are going after some hard-to-get genes, and so quality of specimens is very important.  Simply dropping large specimens in warm ethanol will usually not work.  Here are recommendations.</p>
  	<i>Ethanol preservation:</i>
   <ul>
       <li>use 95% or 100% ethanol, the higher concentration the better</li>
       <li>for specimens larger than a few millimeters long, pulling the abdomen off slightly (it can be just a couple of millimeters, so that the abdomen is still connected via soft tissue to the rest of the body) will allow ethanol to penetrate, and this can vastly increase the quality of the DNA. For very large specimens (>20 mm), it is best to remove a couple of legs or thoracic muscle and place that in a separate vial with ethanol.</li>
       <li>specimens should not be too crowded; there should be many times more ethanol in the vial than beetle biomass.  If you can't avoid a bit of crowding, then change the ethanol more frequently</li>
       <li>when possible, have the ethanol cold (ideally in the freezer) when you drop the live specimens in.  This will generally not be possible in the field, but if you can manage it in the lab, please leave the specimen in the very cold ethanol for a day or two before you take it out of the freezer.</li>
       <li>change the ethanol in the vial at least twice (once a few hours after killing, once a week or so later.)</li>
       <li>specimens should be kept cold, in a fridge or freezer. Do *not* keep the specimens in a frost-free (defrosting) freezer, as the freeze-thaw cycles that these undergo will damage the DNA.</li>
   </ul>
   <i>Silica gel:</i>
   <ul>
       <li>a vial can be half-filled with silica gel, held in by a layer of cotton, with the specimen about this</li>
       <li>the silica gel should be replaced if it absorbs too much water</li>
       <li>larger specimens (large than 2 cm) should have a few legs removed and preserved in a separate vial with silica gel</li>
   </ul>

<H3>Sending specimens to the molecular labs</H3>

    <p>For shipping via mail, ethanol can be decanted from the vial, and an ethanol-moistened cotton ball can be inserted instead.  Faster shipping methods are better than slow shipping methods.</p>
   <p>Specimens should be shipped, with the associated locality and habitat information, to Alex Wild (Adephaga, Myxophaga, Archostemata, and Scirtoidea) or Duane McKenna (all non-scirtoid Polyphaga).</p>

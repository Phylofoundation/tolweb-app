<h2 class="clear">Criteria for choosing BTOL taxa</h2>
<p>Genera for the BTOL should be chosen with care.  Most importantly, we need to choose genera that are key phylogenetically - 
we want to sample as many distinct phylogenetic lineages as possible that allow us to understand the phylogeny of beetles (subordinal-level, superfamily level, family level, and to a lesser extent subfamily level).  E.g., make sure that if two or more genera are included within a family, 
choose representatives of both sides of the basal split.</p>


<p> In addition, genera should have as many as possible of the following properties:</p>


<p><b>Tier 1 and Tier 2</b></p>
<UL>
	<li>larvae are available of that genus or a closely-related genus</li>
	<li>both male and female adults are available for morphology</li>
	<li>specimens of this genus are relatively easy to collect, and will be available in the future if more specimens are needed (this is especially important for Tier 1)</li>
	<li>adults and larvae are not so highly modified that standard characters are gone (e.g., avoid blind, wingless troglobites)</li>
</ul>


<p><b>All Tiers</b></p>
<UL>
	<li>have species that are easier to identify (i.e., choose a genus for which their exists a revision).</li>
	<li>are types of family-group names</li>
</ul>

<p>Some taxa we choose will not fit all of these criteria.  For example, if we can magically get <i>Crowsoniella</i> for DNA, we will include those as Tier 2 even though larvae are unknown.</p>
<p>Note that for some groups we will not be able to get DNA and larvae from the same species, and so will need to make chimeras in the final analyses.  This chimeras should be between taxa that we are confident form a clade relative to the other BTOL taxa.</p>

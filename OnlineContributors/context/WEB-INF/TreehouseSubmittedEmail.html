Student treehouses are not submitted to the ToL for publication until you 
review them for a few key areas. To do so, login and select to "Review 
Submitted Treehouses"  from either the treehouse manager or the classroom 
manager.

From the "Review Submitted Treehouses" page you can view the treehouse and the 
areas to be reviewed and decide if the treehouse is ready to be submitted to 
the ToL for publication, or if it should be returned to the student to revise.

Note that the student had to check off a list that indicated their treehouse 
was ready for publication before it was submitted to you. 
You can view an example of what this checklist consists of at:

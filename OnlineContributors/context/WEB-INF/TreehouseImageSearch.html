		<p class="indentleft">The following tips will help you find the maximum number of results and/or complete a successful search for media in the ToL database. </p>
		<ul class="infolist">
			<li><strong>Less is more.</strong> Typing text into <em>only one search field</em> will help maximize your results. Also, typing in less text will help avoid typos and misspellings. </li>
			<li><strong>Don't type something into each search field. </strong>The exception is if you are looking for a very specific type of media file.</li>
			<li><strong>Don't use spaces between words that you are searching for. </strong>The exception is if you are searching on a scientific name for a group of organisms or the name of a copyright holder. However, we still recommend you initially type in only one word. </li>
			<li><strong>If you contributed the media yourself </strong>and you are the copyright owner, you can search by your name in the <strong>Copyright Owner</strong> field. </li>
			<li><strong>If you know the name of the file</strong> you contributed you can use the <strong>File Name</strong> field. </li>
			<li><strong>When looking for media you did not contribute, </strong> type search criteria in the &quot;<strong>Attached to Group</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Text in Any Media Data Field</strong>&quot; sections. We recommend that you try typing in what you are looking for in &quot;<strong>Attached to  Group</strong>&quot; first, because if we have an image or other media file of this organism you should be able to find it in this way. However, if you are using a common name for a group of organisms (such as butterfly rather than Lepidoptera) you may be more successful if you type text into &quot;<strong>Text in any Media Data Field</strong>&quot;.</li>
			<li><strong>See </strong><a href="/tree/learn/TreebuilderTools/BuildingGuide/SciNames.html" target="fullHelpWindow">help with scientific names</a> to find out some of the scientific names you can use to search for media of various organisms. </li>

    <p>ToL scientific contributors may upload materials to the Tree of Life database 
        and send emails and other communications to Tree of Life staff and contributors, 
        so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, 
        an invasion of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights or 
        otherwise injurious to third parties. ToL contributors may not use false 
        email addresses, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead 
        as to the origin of any communication, message or other content. While 
        the Tree of Life Project is not obliged to review all content that is 
        published by contributors on the Tree of Life web site, we reserve the 
        right to delete any contribution, or take action against any registered 
        account, at any time, for any reason.</p>
           <p>ToL scientific contributors keep the copyright for materials submitted 
        to the Tree of Life database, and a copyright notice is printed alongside

        submitted materials according to the selected license. To the best 
        of the contributor's knowledge, use of the contribution by the Tree of 
        Life Project does not violate any intellectual property rights and will 
        not cause injury to any person or entity. The Tree of Life Project or

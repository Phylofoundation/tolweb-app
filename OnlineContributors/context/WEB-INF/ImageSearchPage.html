<h3><a name="searchtips"></a>Media Search Tips <img src="/tree/home.pages/pictures/tip.gif" alt=" " width="16" height="16" class="inline" /></h3>
<p>The ToL Media Search lets you search for images, movies, sounds, and documents according to a variety
of different criteria. A media search will retrieve a given media file only
if the relevant information is stored in the ToL database. Some materials that
fit your criteria may not yet have been annotated accordingly and may therefore
not show up in your media search results. If your search does not find the materials you are looking for, try using fewer search criteria. We are continuously improving
the annotation of media files, so the quality of media search results will
improve over time. </p>

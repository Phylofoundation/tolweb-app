<a name="TermsAndConditions"></a> <p><strong>In order to register as a ToL
Treehouse Builder, you must agree to the following </strong></p> <h4><strong>Terms and
Conditions for ToL Treehouse Builders:</strong></h4> 
<p>ToL Treehouse Builders
must be at least 18 years old. Kids under 18 must register as Young Treehouse Builders when this option becomes available.</p>

<p>ToL Treehouse Builders may upload materials to the Tree of Life
database and send emails and other communications to Tree of Life staff
and contributors, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene,
threatening, defamatory, an invasion of privacy, infringing of
intellectual property rights or otherwise injurious to third parties.
Treehouse Builders may not use false email addresses, impersonate any
person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any
communication, message or other content. While the Tree of Life Project
is not obliged to review all content that is published by contributors
on the Tree of Life web site, we reserve the right to delete any
contribution, or take action against any registered account, at any
time, for any reason.</p> 
<p>ToL Treehouse Builders generally keep the
copyright for materials submitted to the Tree of Life database, and a copyright notice is always printed alongside contributions displayed on the ToL web site. When a contributor uploads treehouses, images or other media to the Tree of Life database, he or she is asked to specify the intended use of the contribution based on the license options described on the <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/toluse.html">Tree of Life Use of Contributions page</a>.</p> 
<p> ToL Treehouse Builders voluntarily grant the ToL Project and its
collaborators non-exclusive, royalty-free, and full rights to use the
submitted materials according to the selected license. To the best of the contributor's knowledge, use of the contribution
by the Tree of Life Project does not violate any intellectual property
rights and will not cause injury to any person or entity. The Tree of
Life Project or its collaborators take no responsibility and assume no
liability for any contribution made by the contributor or a third
party.</p>

<p>When registering as a ToL Treehouse Builder, you release
the ToL Project, its employees, contractors, consultants, and
collaborators from any and all damages, claims, causes of action,
liabilities, and expenses relating to your participation, or exclusion
or disqualification from participation, in the Tree of Life Project.

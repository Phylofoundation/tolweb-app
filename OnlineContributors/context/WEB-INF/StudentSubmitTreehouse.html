However, don't hesitate to submit your page if you have some formatting problems (e.g. the spacing is off or you are having trouble removing the color from some text) because it is easy for us to reformat your pages. Also, we realize that there are quirks in the Easy Editor that may cause formatting problems for you.</li>

       <p>Remember that you must attach your page to a group for visitors to be able to access it from ToL branch and leaf pages. We will check to make sure you have attached your treehouse to the best place on the ToL. </p>

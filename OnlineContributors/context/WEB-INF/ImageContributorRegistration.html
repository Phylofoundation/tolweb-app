              agree to the following </p>
            <h4>Terms and Conditions for ToL Media Contributors:</h4>
            <p>ToL Media contributors must be at least 18 years old. (Kids 
              under 18 will soon be able to contribute images and media after registering
              as Junior Treehouse Builders.)</p>
            <p>ToL Media Contributors may upload materials to the Tree of 
              Life database and send emails and other communications to Tree of 
              Life staff and contributors, so long as the content is not illegal, 
              obscene, threatening, defamatory, an invasion of privacy, infringing 
              of intellectual property rights or otherwise injurious to third 
              parties. ToL contributors may not use false email addresses, impersonate 
              any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any 
              communication, message or other content. While the Tree of Life 
              Project is not obliged to review all content that is published by 
              contributors on the Tree of Life web site, we reserve the right 
              to delete any contribution, or take action against any registered 
              account, at any time, for any reason.</p>

            <p>ToL Media Contributors generally keep the copyright for materials submitted 
              to the Tree of Life database, and a copyright notice is always printed 
              alongside contributions displayed on the ToL web site. When a contributor 
              uploads images or other media to the Tree of Life database, he or 
              she can specify the intended use of the contribution by the Tree of Life.

              of use. To the best of the contributor's knowledge, use of the contribution 
              by the Tree of Life Project does not violate any intellectual property

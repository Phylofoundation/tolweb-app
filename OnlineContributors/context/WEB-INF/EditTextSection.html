                                         <p>ToL page authors can erect additional text sections according 
                        to the special requirements of their group. Such additional 
                        topics may provide information about biogeography, life 
                        history, life cycle, fossil specimens, putative characteristics 
                        of the ancestor of the group, topics relating the organisms 
                        to humans (e.g., medical importance, economic importance), 
                        etc. </p>
                    <p>In order to keep branch and leaf pages at a manageable 
                        size, custom text sections should not be too long, and 
                        there should not be too many of them on any given page. 
                        Also, branch pages should not take too long to load in 
                        a browser, so large illustrations should be avoided. If 
                        you would like to provide detailed information (i.e., 
                        more than three or four paragraphs) or large media files 
                        for any particular topic, or if there are many different 
                        topics worth covering for your group, you should consider 
                        creating <a href="javascript: w = window.open('/tree/sep/articlesnotes.html', 'documentation', 'width=900, height=700, scrollbars=yes, resizable=yes, toolbar=yes'); w.focus();">scientific 
                        articles or notes</a> for some of your topics. </p>

	            <h6>Inserting Images</h6>
                                      <p>Note that images and other media displayed on ToL pages 
                        are retrieved from the ToL media database. Not all ToL 
                        images are available for use on all ToL pages. You will 
                        only be able to select images that have been released 
                        by their copyright owners for your intended use. If you 
                        would like to use your own images, you first need to upload 
                        the files using the <a href="javascript: w = window.open('/onlinecontributors/app?service=page&page=ImagesManager', 'imagesManagerWindow', 'width=900, height=700, scrollbars=yes, resizable=yes'); w.focus();">ToL 
                        media contribution tools</a>. See <a href="javascript: w = window.open('/tree/sep/images.html', 'documentation', 'width=900, height=700, scrollbars=yes, resizable=yes, toolbar=yes'); w.focus();">Illustrations 
                        for Tree of Life Pages</a> for advice on obtaining images 
                        for your ToL pages. </p>
                    <p>To add an image to your page, click on the <strong>Insert 
                        Image</strong> button <img src="/tree/img/InsertImage.gif" alt=" " />                         in the <em>Easy Mode</em> editor or on the <span class="blue">Add Image</span>                         link in the <em>Advanced Mode</em> editor. 
                        This will open a window that will allow you to search 
                        the <em>ToL Image Database</em> according to a variety of criteria. </p>
                        

                     <p>  <strong><em>Easy Mode</em></strong>: Once you have found an image you would like to use, click on the <span class="blue">select</span> link.  The image will then be inserted at a standard size (250 pixels or smaller) with a default caption (the name of the organism and the copyright notice).  If you would like to explore other size options, click on the <span class="blue">options</span> link next to an image, and then click on the select link next to your preferred image size.  Once the image is inserted in the editor text field, you can format the image 
                       display using the buttons next to the <strong>Insert Image</strong>                         button <img src="/tree/img/InsertImage.gif" alt=" " />.</p>
                        
                   <p>  <strong><em>Advanced Mode</em></strong>:   Once you have found an image you would like to use, copy the <strong>ToL 
                        Image Code</strong> from the yellow box and paste it in the text box in the location where you would like to have the image 
                        displayed. The default image code provides a standard sized image (250 pixels or smaller) with a default caption (the name of the organism and the copyright notice). You can also
                   click on the <span class="blue">options</span> link to explore other size options.

                 For additional formatting
                        options, e.g., for left-aligned or floating images or for the display 
                        of several images next to one another, please have a look

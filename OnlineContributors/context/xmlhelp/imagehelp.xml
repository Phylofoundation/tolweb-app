 <message name="Image Data"><text><![CDATA[
 <p>The top of the <strong>Edit Image Data</strong> form provides an overview of administrative information associated with your image; i. e., it lists the file name and the ID number of the image in the ToL database, and it keeps track of who contributed the image and who last edited the image data.</p>
   <p> Click on the <strong>View/upload/delete versions of this image</strong> link to get an overview of the different versions that are available for your image in the ToL database.  You can use this interface to upload a new master image, which will replace the original version.  You can also constrain the maximum size at which the image is displayed on the ToL web site, and you can upload scaled versions of your master image if you are not satisfied with the quality of our autogenerated scaled versions.</p>

<message name="Copyright Owner">
<text><![CDATA[<p>As a general rule, the creator of an image owns 
						  the copyright and has the exclusive right of distribution. You don't have 
						  to register your work with any authority or agency in order to have it protected by copyright law.</p>
						  <p>The 
						  copyright of the creator may be limited if the material in question 
						  was created as a 'work made for hire', or if the copyright has previously 
						  been relinquished to a publisher.</p>
						  
<p>When you upload a new image to the ToL database, you will be listed as the copyright owner by default.  If you upload an image for which you do not own the copyright, you need to select another option in the <strong>Copyright Information</strong> section:</p>						  
						  
<ul>
<li>If the person or institution who owns the copyright is a registered ToL contributor, you should use the <strong>Select a Contributor</strong> link to locate the contributor in the ToL database.  You should use this tool, rather than typing the person's name in the <em>Copyright Owner</em> text field below, because it ensures that the image gets linked to all the other information about the contributor in the ToL database.</li>
<li>If the copyright owner is not a registered ToL 
      Contributor, you can type the person's name in the <em>Copyright Owner</em> text field. Also, you 
      can provide their e-mail address and/or home page url, which will then be 
      used to create a link in the copyright notice.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>No copyright owner</strong> option only if you are sure that an 
      image is in the public domain, i.e., nobody can claim the right to limit the 
      distribution of this image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter the four-digit year for the copyright 
      date. You are not required to provide a copyright date, but it's part of 
      a proper copyright notice. Generally, it's good to use the date of creation 
      or the date of first publication as the copyright date.</p>

<message name="Use Permitted by Copyright Owner">
<text><![CDATA[
						
<p>When you contribute an image to the ToL project, we ask you to give us 
        a license specifying how the picture can be used. In order 
        to meet the needs of a diverse community of contributors, we provide a variety of different 
        options regarding the publication and potential reuse of your image. 
    </p>
    <p>In the <strong>Edit Image Data</strong> form, you can click on the text next to a radio button to get a detailed explanation of each option.</p>
	<p> You can change the default license applied to your future media contributions by checking the <strong>Remember this option for my future contributions</strong> box.  </p>
		<p>Note that the <strong>Use Permitted by Copyright Owner</strong> section is active only for works protected by copyright.  If you have selected <strong>No copyright owner</strong> above, the public domain option is selected automatically.</p>

<message name="Attached to Group(s)">
<text><![CDATA[<p>When you click on the <strong>Add a Group from the ToL Database</strong> link, you will be able to search for the names of groups in the ToL database.  Please attach your image to that 
        group in the Tree of Life to which it is most relevant.  </p> 
        
        <p>If you have an 
        image of a specimen of a certain species and that species is represented 
        in the ToL database, you should attach it to this species. If the species 
        is not yet represented in the ToL database, you should attach your image 
        to the group that is closest to the species, e.g., the genus or the family 
        that the species belongs to.  If your image is relevant to more than one group (e. g., if it shows specimens of two different species), you can attach it to each of these groups.</p>
      <p>Attaching the images in the ToL database to groups in the tree will allow people to find images based on phylogenetic criteria.  For example, when you attach a picture of a platypus to the <em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</em> group, people will find this picture not only if they search for platypus pictures, but also if they search for pictures of Monotremata, mammals, vertebrates, animals etc.</p>

   <message name="Image Content"><text><![CDATA[
<p> Select one or more features that describe the content of your image. 
Categorizing the content of your image will help people find ToL images based on certain criteria. </p><p>  
 Filling out the <strong>Image Content</strong> section is entirely voluntary.  If you go through the trouble to provide this information, our image database will get better organized, and it will be easier for ToL visitors and page authors to find the illustrations they are most interested in.
For example, somebody looking for a nice picture of a beetle, would probably want to look only at pictures that have the <strong>Specimen(s)</strong> option selected. If you have a picture that's particularly suitable to illustrate a particular subject within biology, you can open the <strong>Subject/Keywords</strong> section below and select relevant subjects.

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Location</strong>: Provide information about the location where the image was taken. If the organism shown in the image was found in a different location, this information may be more relevant than the place where the image was created.  If the organism is not native to the location where it was found, you may also want to provide information about its origin.</li>
  <li><strong>Date/Time</strong>: For some images, it may be good to know when exactly the image was created.  For example, when a photograph 
      was taken will tell you things like when an organism is out and about in a given location, when a plant is blooming, when an animal is displaying 
      a certain behavior, etc.</li>

<p>If your image shows a specimen of an organism, providing some information about the specimen will make your image a more valuable resource. </p>

<ul>
<li>Please provide information about the <strong>condition of the specimen</strong> shown in your image. If the specimen is a fossil, you can also enter the geological period in which the fossil specimen lived. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific Name</strong>: If the species of the specimen shown in your image is not yet represented in the ToL database, you should provide the scientific name of this species here.  This will allow us to attach your image to the species as soon as it is added to the ToL database.  If your image shows organisms 
      belonging to different groups, you can enter the scientific name of each organism 
      and separate individual entries with commas.</li>
<li><strong>Identified By</strong>: You can provide the name of the person who identified 
      the specimen.  This field is particularly useful, if this person is a known expert of the group.</li>

                    <message name="Image Versions Help"><text><![CDATA[
  
 <p> When you upload an image to the ToL database, we will automatically generate 
        several, scaled versions of your image for use in different ToL contexts; 
        for example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>         If your image is used as a title illustration on a ToL branch page, 
            the page author will most likely want to grab a version that is between 
            200 and 300 pixels high, depending on the dimensions of the other 
            images in the title illustration array.
    </li>
    <li>If your image is used as a title illustration on a ToL leaf page, the 
        page author will most likely want to grab a slightly larger version, up 
        to 400 or 500 pixels high.</li>
    <li>Thumbnails are used in search results as well as in captions for title 
        illustrations, etc.</li>
</ul>
    <p>In order to preserve image quality, images are only scaled down, never 
        enlarged. This means that the uploaded <strong>Master</strong> image (by 
        default, the largest version you upload) provides an upper limit for the 
        available image dimensions. Our image processing software generally gives 
        very good results when shrinking images. You can check what your image 
        will look like at different, autogenerated dimensions by clicking on the 
        <em>view</em> links in the <em>Versions for Image</em> list. Also, you 
        have the option to upload additional, manually edited versions of your 
        image, which will then be used instead of the autogenerated versions.</p>

    <p>If you do not want to release your <strong>Master</strong> image for display 
        on the ToL site, you can select another version of the image in the <strong>MaxSize</strong>         column. We will then use your <strong>Master</strong> image only for the 
        creation of display versions not exceeding the size of the <strong>MaxSize</strong>         version. This allows contributors to provide high quality images to the 
        ToL for processing without making the original available to the public. Note that the master image will be accessible to any ToL editor and contributor who has editing privileges for this form.</p>

 <message name="Movie Data"><text><![CDATA[
 <p>The top of the <strong>Edit Movie Data</strong> form provides an overview of administrative information associated with your file; i. e., it lists the file name and the ID number of the media file in the ToL database, and it keeps track of who contributed the file and who last edited the data.</p>
 <p>We will soon provide the option to  <strong>Upload a thumbnail image for your movie</strong>, which will then be used to represent your movie on ToL web pages.  For the time being, a generic movie icon will be used.</p>
   <p>If you find a flaw in a movie file you have uploaded, or if a better version of your file becomes available, you can use the <strong>Replace this movie with a new version</strong> option to upload the revised file.

<message name="Copyright Owner">
<text><![CDATA[<p>As a general rule, the creator of a movie owns 
						  the copyright and has the exclusive right of distribution. You don't have 
						  to register your work with any authority or agency in order to have it protected by copyright law.</p>
						  <p>The 
						  copyright of the creator may be limited if the material in question 
						  was created as a 'work made for hire', or if the copyright has previously 
						  been relinquished to a publisher.</p>
						  
<p>When you upload a new movie file to the ToL database, you will be listed as the copyright owner by default.  If you upload a movie for which you do not own the copyright, you need to select another option in the <strong>Copyright Information</strong> section:</p>						  
						  
<ul>
<li>If the person or institution who owns the copyright is a registered ToL contributor, you should use the <strong>Select a Contributor</strong> link to locate the contributor in the ToL database.  You should use this tool, rather than typing the person's name in the <em>Copyright Owner</em> text field below, because it ensures that the movie file gets linked to all the other information about the contributor in the ToL database.</li>
<li>If the copyright owner is not a registered ToL 
      Contributor, you can type the person's name in the <em>Copyright Owner</em> text field. Also, you 
      can provide their e-mail address and/or home page url, which will then be 
      used to create a link in the copyright notice.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>No copyright owner</strong> option only if you are sure that a movie is in the public domain, i.e., nobody can claim the right to limit the 
      distribution of this movie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter the four-digit year for the copyright 
      date. You are not required to provide a copyright date, but it's part of 
      a proper copyright notice. Generally, it's good to use the date of creation 
      or the date of first publication as the copyright date.</p>

<message name="Use Permitted by Copyright Owner">
<text><![CDATA[
						
<p>When you contribute a movie to the ToL project, we ask you to give us 
        a license specifying how the file can be used. In order 
        to meet the needs of a diverse community of contributors, we provide a variety of different 
        options regarding the publication and potential reuse of your movie. 
    </p>
    <p>In the <strong>Edit Movie Data</strong> form, you can click on the text next to a radio button to get a detailed explanation of each option.</p>
						<p> You can change the default license applied to your future media contributions by checking the <strong>Remember this option for my future contributions</strong> box.  </p>
		<p>Note that the <strong>Use Permitted by Copyright Owner</strong> section is active only for works protected by copyright.  If you have selected <strong>No copyright owner</strong> above, the public domain option is selected automatically.</p>

 <li><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>: Here you can acknowledge any person or institution 
      that has facilitated the creation or distribution of the movie.</li> 
      <li><strong>Creator</strong>: You can use this field to give credit to the person who created the movie. In most cases, the copyright owner and the creator will be the same person, and it's not necessary to credit the creator separately.</li>     
 
 <li><strong>Reference/Source</strong>: Click on the Reference/Source header to open up the section where you can edit this information.

  <li><strong>Source</strong>: If you have copied this document from another website, please provide relevant information here. The <strong>Title of Source File</strong> should be the file name or the title of the page on which the source file is featured. The <strong>Url of Source File</strong> should ideally be the url of the page that provides access to the source file and any data associated with the source file. Select the <strong>Source Collection</strong> from the menu, or enter the relevant data for a new source collection in the <strong>Collection</strong> (name of the collection) and <strong>Homepage</strong> fields.

<message name="Attached to Group(s)">
<text><![CDATA[<p>When you click on the <strong>Add a Group from the ToL Database</strong> link, you will be able to search for the names of groups in the ToL database.  Please attach your file to that 
        group in the Tree of Life to which it is most relevant.  </p> 
        
        <p>If you have a movie featuring a specimen of a certain species and that species is represented 
        in the ToL database, you should attach it to this species. If the species 
        is not yet represented in the ToL database, you should attach your file 
        to the group that is closest to the species, e.g., the genus or the family 
        that the species belongs to.  If your file is relevant to more than one group (e. g., if it features specimens of two different species), you can attach it to each of these groups.</p>
      <p>Attaching media files in the ToL database to groups in the tree will allow people to find resources based on phylogenetic criteria.  For example, when you attach a movie of a platypus to the <em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</em> group, people will find this file not only if they search for platypus movies, but also if they search for movies of Monotremata, mammals, vertebrates, animals etc.</p>

   <message name="Media Content"><text><![CDATA[
   <p>Please be sure to provide a <strong>Title</strong> that concisely and accurately describes the content of your movie.  You can also provide a more detailed <strong>Description</strong> that can serve as an abstract for your movie.</p>
<p> You can also check one or more features that describe the content of your movie as well as relevant subjects and key words. 
</p><p>   If you go through the trouble of providing detailed metadata about the content of your movie, our media database will get better organized, and it will be easier for ToL visitors and page authors to find the media they are most interested in.
For example, somebody looking for a movie illustration mating behavior in insects would probably want to focus their search on movies attached to a group in the insect branch that have the <strong>Specimen(s)</strong> and <strong>Neurobiology & Behavior</strong> options selected.

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Location</strong>: For documentaries, provide information about the location where the movie was created. If the organism featured in the movie was found in a different location, this information may be more relevant than the place where the movie was shot.  If the organism is not native to the location where it was found, you may also want to provide information about its origin.</li>
  <li><strong>Date/Time</strong>: For some movies, it may be good to know when exactly they were created.  For example, when a movie was shot will tell you things like when an organism is out and about in a given location, when a plant is blooming, when an animal is displaying 
      a certain behavior, etc.</li>

<message name="Specimen Information">
<text><![CDATA[
<p>If your movie features specimens of organisms, providing some information about these specimens will make your movie a more valuable resource. </p>

<ul>
<li>Please provide information about the <strong>condition of the specimen</strong> featured in your movie. If the specimen is a fossil, you can also enter the geological period in which the fossil specimen lived. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific Name</strong>: If the species of a specimen featured in your movie is not yet represented in the ToL database, you should provide the scientific name of this species here.  This will allow us to attach your media file to the species as soon as it is added to the ToL database.  If your movie features organisms 
      belonging to different groups, you can enter the scientific name of each organism 
      and separate individual entries with commas.</li>
<li><strong>Identified By</strong>: You can provide the name of the person who identified 
      the specimen.  This field is particularly useful, if this person is a known expert of the group.</li>
<li><strong>Behavior</strong>:  Here you can provide information about the behavior 
      displayed by the organism featured in your movie. Possible kinds of behavior 
      are courtship, mating, feeding, predator avoidance, pollination, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Sex</strong>: For many organisms, it's difficult to tell their 
      sex from a movie. Enter this information only if you are sure you know 
      the sex of the specimen.</li>
<li><strong>Life Cycle Stage</strong>:  Here you can indicate whether the specimen is 
      a juvenile or adult. You can also enter more specific information, e.g., 
      second instar larva, pupa, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Body Part</strong>: If your movie focuses on a particular body part (e. g. a documentary of crustacean feeding structures) or if it provides a particularly good view of a given body part, you can provide this information here.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong>: If your movie was shot from a particular view, you can provide this information here, e.g., dorsal (from the top), ventral (from the bottom), lateral (from the side), frontal (from the front), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: Enter information relevant to the size of the 
      organism, indicating what part of the organism has been measured, e.g., 
      body length, diameter, length including appendages, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Specimen Documentation</strong>: This section contains fields that are generally relevant only for taxonomists.</li>

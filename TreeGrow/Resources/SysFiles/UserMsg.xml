A group assignment will provide a person with the privilege to download

You can add additional contributors to this <b><i>Contributor Pool</i></b> either by 
establishing a new entry for a person who is not yet in the ToL contributors database

from the ToL Database (<b><i>Fetch Contributor from Database</i></b>). You will need 
a network connection to do the latter.

Once a contributor has been added to the <b><i>Contributor Pool</i></b>, you will be able 
to simply select this person as a contributor in a variety of different places, e.g., as page authors or as copyright owners. <p><p>
Any contributors you add will remain in this <b><i>Contributor Pool</i></b> as long as you 
have the current branch downloaded.  However, when you check in the branch, 
the <b><i>Contributor Pool</i></b> will be reset to contain only people who are assigned to nodes 
in a given branch or who are already selected as contributors of materials attached to nodes in the branch.         ]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[<html> This window provides an overview of all the images that are <i>attached to a node</i>  in the current download or that are <i>used on a page</i> attached to a node in the current  download.   You can edit data for an image either here or in the <b><i>Images Panel</i></b> of the Node Data Window for the node that the image is attached to.<p><p> 
Why do we have this alternative handling of images in the <b><i>Images Window</i></b> on the one hand and the <b><i>Images Panels</i></b> on the other?  The  <b><i>Images Window</i></b> is meant to be the central place for working with images 
for the downloaded branch and for editing image data; while the <b><i>Images Panel</i></b> of the Node Data Window is meant to give an overview of those images that are relevant specifically to one particular node.  The significance of the <b><i>Images Panels</i></b> for individual nodes will become increasingly important as we add more images to the ToL database not specifically for use on ToL pages, but for retrieval in phylogenetically structured queries to serve a variety of purposes. </html> ]]></text>
    </message>
    <message name="IMAGE_ATTACHMENT_TOOLTIP">
        <text><![CDATA[<html>When adding new images to the ToL Database, we ask that you attach them to the most specific node possible; i.e., if you have an image of a specimen of a certain species and  the node for this species is represented in the ToL database, you should attach it to the  species node, even if you are going to use the image as a title illustration on the branch  page for the order or the family.  This means that many ToL images will not be attached  to a given node, although they may be used as illustrations on a page attached to this  node. <p><p> Why are we handling image attachments in this way?  It is our goal to impose  phylogenetic structure upon the ToL image collection, so that we can query the ToL image database for images attached to a particular set of nodes; e.g., we could ask for    all the images that are attached to the Tyrannosauridae node and its descendants.  If an  image of a Tyrannosaurus was attached to the Dinosauria page, it wouldn't get picked up in such a query.
Developing the phylogenetic structure of the ToL image database will long be a work in progress.  
Since the ToL started out without any attachment data associated with image files, we still have
much clean-up work to do, and we would appreciate your help in attaching your own images to the 
proper nodes.  For the time being, we have attached most images to the nodes of the pages they are 
attached to since we could easily do this automatically.   </html>         ]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[<html> Page authors have the option to automatically compile the data stored with images into a caption, or they can write a <b><i>Custom Caption</i></b> themselves. In many cases, the best solution will be a mixed format, with a brief custom  caption giving general information about the image array, followed by a listing of the <b><i>Image Data</i></b>. <p><p>  The display of the two components is controlled by two check boxes, which are both checked by default.  Below the <b><i>Custom Caption</i></b> text field, there's a crude preview of the caption as it is going to be shown on the ToL page.  Note that the image copyright data are always going to get printed, even if you deselect the <b><i>Print Image Data</i></b> option. This means that you need not include any copyright information in your <b><i>Custom Caption</i></b>.                              ]]></text>

    <message name="NODE_IMAGES_TOOLTIP">
        <text><![CDATA[<html> This panel shows you all the images that are attached to this node.  You can add  additional images to the node using the <b><i>Add</i></b> button below the  <b><i>Node Images</i></b> list, and you can remove images from this node by using the <b><i>Delete</i></b> button.  Note that removing an image from a node will not delete it from the ToL database.  The image just won't be attached to this node anymore. <p><p> You can edit data for an image either here or in the <b><i>Images Window</i></b> (accessible from the Window menu), which provides an overview of all the images that  are either <i>attached to a node</i> included in the current download or <i>used on a  page</i> attached to a node included in the current download. <p><p> When adding new images to the ToL Database, we ask that you attach them to the most specific node possible; i.e., if you have an image of a specimen of a certain species and the node for this species is represented in the ToL database, you should attach it to the  species node, even if you are going to use the image as a title illustration on the branch  page for the order or the family.  This means that many ToL images will not be attached  to a given node, although they may be used as illustrations on a page attached to this  node. <p><p> Why are we handling image attachments in this way?  It is our goal to impose phylogenetic structure upon the ToL image collection, so that we can query the ToL  image database for images attached to a particular set of nodes; e.g., we could ask for    all the images that are attached to the Tyrannosauridae node and its descendants.  If an  image of a Tyrannosaurus was attached to the Dinosauria page, it wouldn't get picked up  in such a query. <p><p> Fleshing out image data and developing the phylogenetic structure of the ToL image database will long be a work in progress.  Since the ToL started out without any data  associated with image files, we still have much data entry work to do, and we would  appreciate your help in entering data for your own images.  For the time being, we have  attached most images to the nodes of the pages they are attached to (we could easily do  this automatically), and we have entered image data (harvested from custom captions)  for most of the ToL title illustrations.                 ]]></text>

<message name="EDIT_IMAGE_DATA_TOOLTIP">        
        <text><![CDATA[<html>        
In order to edit image  data, you first need to check them out from the ToL database by
clicking on the <b><i>Edit image data</i></b> button (you need a network connection to
do this).  When you are done editing image data, please check them back in. 
<p><p>
Fleshing out image data will long be a work in progress.  Since the ToL started out
without any data  associated with image files, we still have much data entry work to do, 
and we would  appreciate your help in entering data for your own images.  For the time 
being, we have entered image data (harvested from custom captions) for most of the ToL
title illustrations.
<p><p> 
Currently, you will be able to edit image data for any image attached to a node within
your realm of authority.  However, we ask that you please not edit the data for other 
people's images without their explicit permission.  It is our goal to soon implement a more 
sophisticated system restricting the editing of image data to copyright owners and/or 
image contributors, and allowing others to just add notes in a special field.

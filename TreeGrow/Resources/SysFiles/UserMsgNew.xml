    <message name="CONTRIBUTORS_ASSIGNMENT_TOOLTIP">
        <text><![CDATA[<html>         <p>Contributors should be assigned to the group to which they are expected to contribute.  You can assign contributors to any node within your  realm of authority.  If you would like to have a person assigned to a node for which you do not have assignment privileges, please send a request to treegrow@tolweb.org, and we will take care of it for you. <br><br> By default, <b><i>TreeGrow</i></b> will assign the basal node of the current download  to any new contributors you add to the ToL database.  You can then adjust group assignments as needed. 
<br><br> 
A group assignment will provide a person with the privilege to download 
and edit the assigned node and its descendants, as well as making 
group assignments to other people within their realm of authority.  
Group assignments should therefore be made only for ToL authors and 
coordinators and not for contributors of other materials like images and other media. </p></html>]]></text>

Any image added through the link from a node data window will automatically be attached to the relevant node. 
 When adding new images to the ToL Database, we ask that you attach them to the most specific node possible; i.e., if you have an image of a specimen of a certain species and the node for this species is represented in the ToL database, you should attach it to the  species node, even if you are going to use the image as a title illustration on the branch  page for the order or the family.  This means that many ToL images will not be attached  to a given node, although they may be used as illustrations on a page attached to this  node.<br><br>The <strong>Manage my Images/Media</strong> link will take you to the ToL Media manager in your browser.  Here you can upload new images, and delete, or edit data for your images in the ToL database.   </p>

    <message name="TITLE_ILLUSTRATIONS_TOOLTIP">
        <text><![CDATA[<html><p>This panel lets you select images as title illustrations for your ToL page.  If you click on the <strong>Edit Title Illustrations</strong> link, you will be taken to a form in your browser that lets you add images to the array, delete images from the array, or change the sequence of images.  The caption for your array can be generated automatically from image data, or you can compose a custom caption in the online form.  Once you have created a title illustrations array, you can preview it on the ToL development site.  Click on the <strong>Refresh</strong> button to get a thumbnail preview of the current array in this panel.<br><br>Click on <strong>Add New Image to the Database</strong> to upload a new image to the ToL database.   Any image added through the link from a node data window will automatically be attached to the relevant node. When adding new images to the ToL Database, we ask that you attach them to the most specific node possible; i.e., if you have an image of a specimen of a certain species and the node for this species is represented in the ToL database, you should attach it to the  species node, even if you are going to use the image as a title illustration on the branch  page for the order or the family.  This means that many ToL images will not be attached to a given node, although they may be used as illustrations on a page attached to this  node.</p>

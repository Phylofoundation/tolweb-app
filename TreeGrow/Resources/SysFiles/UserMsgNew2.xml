    <message name="CONTRIBUTORS_ASSIGNMENT_TOOLTIP">
        <text><![CDATA[<html>         <p>Contributors should be assigned to the group to which they are expected to contribute.  You can assign contributors to any node within your  realm of authority.  If you would like to have a person assigned to a node for which you do not have assignment privileges, please send a request to treegrow@tolweb.org, and we will take care of it for you. <br><br> By default, <b><i>TreeGrow</i></b> will assign the basal node of the current download  to any new contributors you add to the ToL database.  You can then adjust group assignments as needed. 
<br><br> 
A group assignment will provide a person with the privilege to download 
and edit the assigned node and its descendants, as well as making 
group assignments to other people within their realm of authority.  
Group assignments should therefore be made only for ToL authors and 
coordinators and not for contributors of other materials like images and other media. </p></html>]]></text>

You can add additional contributors to this <b><i>Contributor Pool</i></b> either by 
establishing a new entry for a person who is not yet in the ToL contributors database

from the ToL Database (<b><i>Fetch Contributor from Database</i></b>). You will need

        <text><![CDATA[<html> This panel shows you all the images that are attached to this node.  Click on <strong>View</strong> to see a full-sized version of the image in your web browser, along with a summary of image data. If you have editing privileges for an image, there will also be an <strong>Edit</strong> link, which will let you access the <strong>Edit Image Data</strong> form in your web browser.<br><br>The <strong>Add New Image...</strong> link will take you to a form in your browser that lets you upload a new image to the ToL database.  Any image added through the link from a node data window will automatically be attached to the relevant node. 
 When adding new images to the ToL Database, we ask that you attach them to the most specific node possible; i.e., if you have an image of a specimen of a certain species and the node for this species is represented in the ToL database, you should attach it to the  species node, even if you are going to use the image as a title illustration on the branch  page for the order or the family.  This means that many ToL images will not be attached  to a given node, although they may be used as illustrations on a page attached to this  node. </p>
